From Spoken Ideas to Structured Outcomes

🚀 Project Overview

link to - banner.png
Talk2Task is an AI-powered, voice-first meeting and idea intelligence platform that converts live conversations into structured, professional, and execution-ready outputs like PPTs, Minutes of Meeting (MoM), reports, and visual diagrams.

It is built for students, startups, companies, hackathon teams, and innovators who want productive meetings without manual effort.

💡 Core Idea (Simple & Clear)
People speak naturally during discussions.
👉 Talk2Task listens in real time, understands who is speaking, in which language, with what intent and emotion, structures ideas intelligently, and instantly generates actionable outputs.
No typing. No language barriers. No missed ideas.

❗ Problem → Solution
Meetings are usually unstructured, multilingual, time-consuming, and require manual documentation.
Talk2Task solves this by using AI to automatically capture, understand, organize, and visualize discussions in real time.

🚀 Innovation & Novelty
TalkToTask goes beyond traditional meeting tools by combining voice-first interaction, real-time multilingual intelligence, sentiment awareness, and gesture-based visualization in a single platform. Instead of just recording meetings, it understands conversations, structures ideas intelligently, and converts them into execution-ready assets instantly — a capability missing in existing tools.

🧩 System Architecture (Textual Overview)

The system follows a layered AI architecture. Voice, facial expressions, and gestures act as inputs. These are processed by Speech-to-Text, Computer Vision, and Emotion AI models. A central LLM-based intelligence layer understands context, intent, and meaning. A decision layer handles voting and prioritization, and finally an output layer generates PPTs, MoMs, reports, visuals, and summaries.


📝 Project Abstract 
TalkToTask is an AI-powered, voice-first meeting intelligence platform that transforms unstructured, multilingual discussions into structured and actionable outcomes. By leveraging speech recognition, large language models, computer vision, and sentiment analysis, the system automatically generates summaries, PPTs, MoMs, visual diagrams, and individual performance insights. The platform enhances collaboration, improves decision-making through built-in voting, and removes manual documentation effort, making meetings more productive, inclusive, and execution-focused.
